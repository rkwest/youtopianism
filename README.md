Youtopianism
============


What?
=====

A decentralized open-source religion focused on creating a better future through optimism and a focus on individual responsibility.

Why?
====

* If we can know right from wrong we should choose what is right.
* If we have the opportunity to do what is right we should take it.
* If there is no single culturaly accepted moral code, then we must create our own. 
* If there is no god then we need to save ourselves.

How?
====

1. Call yourself a Youtopian - now you are one.
2. If you write a statement of beliefs and make it publically available, you have One Star.
3. If you write a vision of utopia and make it publically available, you have an additional Two Stars.
4. If you have currently taken a concrete action (outside your own head) in the last thirty days to bring your vision of utopia closer to reality, you have an additional Four Stars.

Thus at any point in time you have between Zero and Seven Stars.

Stars do not denote worth. 
If you earnestly strive each day to build a 'utopia' of pain and suffering then that is not a good thing.
