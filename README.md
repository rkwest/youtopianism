How?

1. Call yourself a Youtopian - now you are one.
2. If you write a statment of beliefs and make it publically available, you have One Star.
3. If you write a vision of utopia and make it publically available, you have an additional Two Stars.
4. If you have currently taken a concrete action (outside your own head) in the last thirty days to bring your vision of utopia closer to reality, you have an additional Four Stars.

Thus at any point in time you have between Zero and Seven Stars.

Stars do not denote worth. If you earnestly strive each day to build a utopia of pain and suffering then that is not a good thing.
